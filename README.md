# AudioReader

Welcome to my first iOS app: **AudioReader** 
A personal learning companion that lets you **listen to audio files** (TTS notes, recorded lectures, audiobooks, etc.) while **reading reference material** (PDFs, EPUBs) — all in one place.

## What It Does (or Will Do Eventually™)

AudioReader is for people like me — students, multitaskers, chaotic learners — who use AI-generated lecture audio, downloaded audiobooks, or converted study material to review on the go. I got tired of switching between apps or digging through Canvas folders just to check a slide.

This app aims to:
- Import `.mp3`, `.wav`, and `.m4b` audio files directly from Files or iCloud
- Pair each audio file with a `.pdf` or `.epub` so you can “read along”
- Let you edit title/cover art so your library looks exactly the way you want it to (because Hatsune Miku is the poster girl of Object Oriented Programming)
- Autoplay books in a series (or course)
- Remember your playback position
- Organize files in folders or collections
- Actually have a UI that doesn't hurt to look at

## Dev Diary: Chaos With Structure

I have no idea what I’m doing — but I’m learning, and that’s kind of the point.  
Here’s how the journey’s going:

### Progress So Far
- [x] Create repository
- [x] Think about app idea
- [x] Download Xcode
- [x] Make a basic content window
- [x] Make an application that runs
- [x] Add the ability to load audio files
- [x] Add ability to play audio files

### Upcoming Features
- [ ] Add ability to read eBooks (.pdf and .epub)
- [ ] Save progress: remember where you left off
- [ ] Handle multiple files in a library
- [ ] Pair eBooks and audiobooks together
- [ ] Organize content into folders/collections
- [ ] Add metadata editing (title, cover art)
- [ ] Design and implement UI
- [ ] Polish for potential TestFlight release

More features (and chaos) to be added along the way.

## Why I'm Building This

I listen to audio versions of my class lectures while walking around campus or doing chores — often converted from slides using AI TTS or tools like NotebookLM’s podcast summaries.

But when I want to check something in the slides, I have to *dig through multiple folders on Canvas* just to find the right file. I wanted something that just… **worked together**.

This is my solution. A personal-use tool that could maybe help others too.

## Built With
- Swift (learning it as I go)
- SwiftUI (because I'm not touching UIKit unless I have to)
- Xcode (fighting for my life)
- AVFoundation for audio playback (bless)
- PDFKit / EPUB rendering coming soon...

## Final Words

This is my first iOS app. I’m learning everything — Swift, Xcode, iOS development — from scratch. It’s messy, but it’s mine.  

Feel free to watch the chaos unfold or fork the repo if you’re building something similar.  
Or just say hi. I'm always down to chat about tech, audio, or weird study hacks.
