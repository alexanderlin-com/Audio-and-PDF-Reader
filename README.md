My first iOS app ever. 

This will be a fun journey. I have absolutely no idea wha I'm doing. Nor do I have any idea how to use Xcode or to code in Swift. Nor have I ever made a working app, like, ever. 
This is like the Dark Souls of app development, probably. 



## Development Progress Checklist:
- create repository (check)
- think about app idea (check)
- download Xcode (check)
- make a basic content window (check)
- make a basic application that runs
- add the ability to load mp3 files
- add ability to play mp3 files
- add basic user interface

more steps will be added as I continue.
